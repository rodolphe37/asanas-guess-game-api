It is helpful to think about extending the foot up rather than out. Continue to lengthen the spine from the neck down to the tailbone. Allow the shoulders to fall into their natural position away from the ears and extend the arms, maintaining the grip on the foot and straightening the leg. Engage the muscles of the thigh for more stability. To achieve the full extension of the pose, round the spine and drop the elbows while lowering the head to your knee.
